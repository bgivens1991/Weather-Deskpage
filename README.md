# Weather-Deskpage
This project is a page that can be kept open in a tab, great for a home page. 

This project will display the time, weather based on the location of the computer, as well as the city and state.  
Two API calls first for the longitude and latitude, then the weather for that specific location are what allow this to work.
The weather and city/state is refreshed every 15 minutes, and the time is always updated so the time is always correct.

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript(JQuery) for this small project.
